This is a project which transforms images using image_io.py, a utility class to help users read/write image files to a
directory. This was a class project for Fall 2021's iteration of CSCI100 at Howard University, taught by Alex Krentsel.

Given a picture, this code will convert it into a 3d list, edit the pixel value according to the preferred filter option, return an edited matrix and
then converts the matrix back into an image using PIL, or more precisely, image_io.py
